# Overview

**Design Pattern** - a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context. It is a blueprint for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. 

**All patterns have:**
 - name
 - the problem they solve (in context)
 - solution
 - consequences
 
### Usage of Design Pattern

**Common platform for developers**: Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. 

**Best Practices**: Why reinvent the wheel when you can follow a field-tested blueprint for solving your not-so-unique problem?
 
### Types of patterns
Pattern | Description
------------ | -------------
**Creational** | These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator.
**Structural** | These design patterns concern class and object composition to obtain new functionalities.
**Behavioral** | These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

Many of the design patterns are in use today originate from the famous Gang of Four book: **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"** by Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. 

# 1. Creational Design Patterns
## 1.1. Factory
**When to use**

- When the implementation of an interface or an abstract class is expected to change frequently
- When the current implementation cannot comfortably accommodate new change
- When the initialization process is relatively simple, and the constructor only requires a handful of parameters

**Implementation**: [Factory](http://github.com)


## 1.2. Abstract Factory
**When to use**
- The client should be independent of how the products are created and composed in the system
- The system consists of multiple families of products, and these families are designed to be used together
- We need a run-time value to construct a particular dependency

## 1.3. Singleton
**When to use**
- For resources that are expensive to create (like database connection objects)
- Itâ€™s good practice to keep all loggers as Singletons which increases performance
- Classes which provide access to configuration settings for the application
- Classes that contain resources that are accessed in shared mode


**Specifics**
- Allows only one instance of a given class
  * The class holds a reference to its only instance
  * Lazy (on request) or static initialization (on load)
  * Private constructor to restrict external instantiation
- Provides global point of access to the instance

  ```public static ClassName getInstance()```
- Supports multiple instances in the future if the requirements change
  * Update getInstance to return multiple (possibly cached) instances if needed

# 2. Structural Design Patterns
## 2.1. Decorator
- Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically and transparently (run-time)
- An alternative to sub classing (compile-time)
- Removes responsibilities no longer needed

## 2.2. Adapter
- Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
- Allows classes to work together despite their incompatible interfaces
- Typically used in development to *glue* components together, especially if 3rd party libraries are used
- Also known as *wrapper*

## 2.3. Composite
- Interface for creating family of related objects
- Clients are independent of how the objects are created, composed, and represented
- System is configured with one of multiple families of products

# 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
## 3.1. Visitor

## 3.2. Observer
- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
- When the observed object (subject) changes state, all dependents get notified and updated automatically

## 3.3. Strategy
- Defines family of interchangeable and encapsulated algorithms
- Changes algorithms independently of clients that use them
